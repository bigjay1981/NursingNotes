Reflect using the Rolfe, Freshwater & Jasper model of reflection (2001)

ReRead the Paper

What?

Explore the significance of this area of practice. I.e. What is the significance of having conversations with patients in the dementia care setting

Why is it a problem? - Is this not done in practice? How does this work in the hospital setting maybe?

Why is communicating significant? - It is a professional requirement and effective communication is required to build therapeutic relationships

Whys is advance care planning significant in dementia care? - Loss of cognitive function - good understanding on the part of decision makers eg family

Why is improving dementia care significant? - aging population, growing number of people with dementia.

Personal example: talk about Jimmy

So What? What does the evidence from this paper add?

What is the evidence base that already exists?

What could I have done differently? In my personal example?

Now What? What does this mean in the context of me as a student nurse and in the future as a registered nurse?

How will this shape and drive current and future learning needs? - Now what skills, - attributes - and knowledge will I need to meet the needs of service users 
and patients?

######################################################### FROM LECTURE ############################################################

What: 
- Look at the title - Pick out relevant words:
	
- Dementia care in general hospitals - Describe the current situation regarding the given issue - Use statistics and other information to support the 
answer
	
- *** Look up national dementia strategy (DH, 2009) ***
	
- Most up to date: PM dementia challenge 2020 (DH, 2015)
	
- NICE Guidelines for dementia
	
- RCN "This is me" 

- Don't just use the above list - there are others. Do a lit search. - Use statistics to describe the issues and problems associated 
with dementia. 

---# This is apparently a good start #---
I have read the article by Goodman et al. (2013) many times since the start of the course. The core themes of the article revolve around the provision 
of effective care for patients with dementia and their priorities and preferences for end of life care. The Department of Health (DH, 2009) state that 
providing effective dementia care is difficult for various factors including the nations aging population, the cost of care delivery and the impact it
has on the patients and their families. Brayne et al. (2006) state that one in three deaths of people over 65 will have dementia as a co-morbidity. According
to the Alzheimer's Society (2014) there are 540,000 people caring for individuals with dementia in the UK.    

- So What: 
- Why is this issue relevant to nursing?
  > The older you get the more likely you are to have a diagnosis of dementia
- Why is this issue relevant to me as a student nurse?
  > Aging population Majority of care delivered by HCA and Student Nurses
- What do I need to know about this issue? - What are the professional implicaions of not taking this information on board
  > Will be unable to take care of an expanding group of people
- What would happen if I failed to alter my practice in light of this newly acquired information?
  > Professional / Negligent in duties

Now What? - What am I going to do about this situation?
  > Where are the gaps in my knowledge?
- What do I need to do in order to enhance my knowledge?
  > Awareness - what has been written about this?)
- How will this improve my future care delivery?
  > E.g. What does agression mean with the dementia sufferer? IT's communication - unfulfilled need
- How can I gain more information about this issue to further my practice?
  > Reading, reading, reading
- What will I need to perfect in my current practice around the issue to ensure that I am constantly learning in order to be competent at the point of care 
delivery and competent at the point of registration?

Remember that reflection is not automatic and it requires thinking.
