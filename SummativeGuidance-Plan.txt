Reflect using Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper (2001)

	- Explore the significance or this area of practice, why is it a problem, reflect on your own experience of patient/service users care related to this issue, good or bad, how did this make you and/or patient feel
	
- So What?
	- What does the evidence from this paper add - what could I have done differently?
	
- Now What?
	- You will explore and reflect upon what this means to you in your current role as a student nurse and in the future as a registered practitioners and how this will shape and drive your current and future learning needs, e.g. Now, what knowledge, skills attitudes and attributes will I need to possess now and in the future to meet the needs of such service-users/patients?
	- REMEMBER: How does this affect my patients care?
