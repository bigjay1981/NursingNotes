Preferences and Priorities for ongoing and end of life care: A qualitative     
study of older people with dementia resident in care homes.
(Goodman et al., 2013)

Notes from Abstract:
BG:              
> Dementia gives limited life expectancy
> Dying trajectory protracted and unpredictable
> Good EoLC  
  > Early communication
  > Exploration of residents' wishes
  > Identification of someone who represents them
> In care homes the timing of these conversations is variable
> Person centred care approach assumes that people with dementia can actively  
participate in decisions about their lives
  > What is less understood is how this can inform EOLC decision making and    
    complement information provided in advance care plans

OBJ:
> Explore how older people with dementia discuss their priorities and preferences
for EOLC

METHODS:
> Exploratory QUALITATIVE study
> using guided conversations (SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS)
> 18 patients sampled
> Patients asked about:
  > Life in the care home
  > Their health
  > Thoughts for the future
  > Wishes surrounding end of life
> Data were analysed thematically (THEMATIC ANALYSIS)

RESULTS:
> The accounts of people with dementia's life in the care home
> what they valued
> the impact of dementia on how they participated in decision making
> Three key themes identified:
  > Dementia and Decision Making
  > Everyday Relationships
  > Place and Purpose

CONCLUSION:
> For older people living with a diagnosis of dementia the experience of living
and dying in a care home is inextricably linked.
> EOLC planning and decision making by HCP, care home staff and family could be
enriched by
  > exploring
  > and; documenting
    > the preoccupations, key relationbships and wishes about everyday care of
      people with dementia

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC?
> Entry to a care home does not mean that a dementia sufferer is at end stage 
  disease or dying
> Death is the expected outcome of the disease process
> Completion of advance care plans prior to significant cognitive impairment is recommended
  > This ensures that the patient receives care consistent with their goals
> Little is known about the everyday experience of people living with dementia
> and how this experience can inform decision making about the end of life

WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
> People with dementia can articulate their preference for care and views about living and dying in a care home
> Preferences and priorities for EOLC are inextricably linked to the everyday experience of living in a care home
  > and if it is viewed by the older person as their home.
> It is vital there is an ongoing exploration of how key relationships and views about the everyday can inform decision making about future care
  > This is to complement any ACP already in place
